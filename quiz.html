    <h2>What is MarxistValues?</h2>
    <p>MarxistValues is a marxist quiz inspired by and based upon the <a
            href="https://leftvalues.github.io/">LeftValues</a> quiz that seeks to identify your position on the marxist
        spectrum. If you are not a marxist, this quiz is obviously not suited for you. You will be presented with a
        statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to
        <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. The questions for each axes are
        presented in order, rather than scattered. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum
        possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
        There are <b>90</b> questions in the test.</p>

    <h2>What are the values?</h2>
    <p>There are currently six axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#560000;">Revolution</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#FC5959;">Reform</b><br />
        Those with a higher revolution score tend to support a radical and rapid overthrow of the capitalist system
        through a mass uprising. Those with a higher reform score tend to favor inducing gradual changes within
        capitalist structures, such as liberal democracy, with the eventual goal of reaching socialism.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#237B88;">Voluntaristic</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#7F7000;">Economistic</b><br />
        Those with higher voluntaristic scores believe social change stems from human will and consciousness, while 
        those with higher economistic scores believe material and economic conditions fundamentally determine social 
        development.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#890000;">Central</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#333333ff;">Decentral</b><br />
        Those with a higher central score tend to support an economic structure based around centralized national
        planning. Those with a higher decentral score tend to support an economic structure based around decentralized
        planning, usually on a more localized scale.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#782F52;">International</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#703A13;">Patriotic</b><br />
        Those with a higher international score tend to support forming an international socialist movement, often with
        the eventual goal of abolishing nations. Those with a higher patriotic score tend to prioritize building
        socialism within existing borders and reject the goal of a world socialist republic.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#963B33;">Party</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#7F333B;">Union</b><br />
        Those with a higher party score tend to favor using political parties as the basis of a socialist movement.
        Those with a higher union score tend to favor using trade unions and other forms of mass organization as a basis
        of a socialist movement. Being pro-party does not necessarily mean you oppose unions and vice versa, it is more
        about preference.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#804E00;">Proletarian</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#586808;">Peasant</b><br />
        Those with a higher proletarian score view the industrial working class as the essential force for revolution,
        while those with a higher peasant score see the rural masses as the fundamental agent of change in the
        modern era.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#263785;">Conservative</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#72A13D;">Progressive</b><br />
        Those with a higher conservative score value preserving traditional social structures and cultural values. 
        Those with a higher progressive score seek to reform or abolish traditions to achieve social liberation.
        </p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#AD5C00;">Dogmatic</b> <b>vs.</b> <b
            style="color:#E37A00;">Pragmatic</b><br />
        Those with a higher dogmatic score believe in the rigid and literal application of Marxist theory, viewing
        deviations as revisionist. Those with a higher pragmatic score advocate for adapting Marxist principles to modern
        material conditions, prioritizing practical results over doctrinal purity.
        </p>
    <h2>What does "Closest Match" mean in the results?</h2>
    <p>Similar to 8values, this quiz will attempt to match you with a specific marxist
        ideology. There are currently fourteen possible ideologies, with more to come in the future. This is a work in
        progress and may not work as intended. Suggestions are very welcome.</p>
